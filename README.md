Simulating runs of Osrank!

We want to know:

0. At what level of R do ranks no longer change?

1. Which projects are getting rewarded?

2. What happens if only a certain subset of the projects submit data, like the top 100 or 1000?

3. Can a project cheat by not reporting their dependencies?

4. Can a project cheat by creating a bunch of fake projects, each of which depend on the initial project?
